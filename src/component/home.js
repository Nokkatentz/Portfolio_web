                            &emsp;&emsp;<span>Hello</span>, my name is <span>Pratchaya Posom</span>. Currently, I am seeking a job as a front-end developer. 
                            I graduated from Naresuan University with a degree in Computer Engineering. I have experience in web development using <span>HTML, CSS, JavaScript </span> 
                            and frameworks such as <span>React Js</span>.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            &emsp;&emsp;During my third year of studies, I had the opportunity to intern with a professor who specialized in IoT system development.
                             In this role, I was involved in developing applications using <span>Dart</span> and the <span>Flutter</span> framework to control IoT devices.<br/>
                             <br/>
                            &emsp;&emsp;For my senior project, I worked on developing an <span>AI model</span> for detecting Triple ridding by using <span>YOLOv5</span> and <span>DeepSort</span>. 
                            I successfully deployed the model in <span>PYQT5</span> to make it user-friendly.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            &emsp;&emsp;I am a self-driven individual who is always eager to learn and grow. I am open to embracing new ideas and perspectives from everyone around me.<br/>
